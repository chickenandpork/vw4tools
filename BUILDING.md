Building
========

This project is a basic Autotools:
1. ./autoreconf -vfi
2. ./configure
3. make

This will create you:
- a java/vw4tools.jar that is the compiled code form this project
- a convjars/vw4tools.jar file that is all the compiled code plus dependencies

This convjars/vw4tools.jar is used on self-testing or regression-testing; it's available at http://chickenandpork.github.io/vw4tools/vw4tools.jar if you really need it to solve a problem TODAY
