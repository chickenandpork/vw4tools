Tools and utilities for Virtual\+Wisdom4

At current, V\+W4\+Tools is a script or two, plus one big jar file. vw4tool.\+jar allows a user to import a text file in one of several formats and output an Entity import J\+S\+O\+N for Virtual\+Wisdom4.

V\+W4\+Tools is intentionally 100\% opensource to both show the code a user may be running on a trusted server, and to emphasize that Support is also of the Open\+Source variety (ie not by V\+I Support). In turn, V\+W4\+Tools uses other projects to achieve its goals\+:

If we support the notion of \char`\"{}\+G\+N\+U/\+Linux\char`\"{} rather than \char`\"{}\+Linux\char`\"{}, then by the same logic, we should refer to java-\/getopt as \char`\"{}\+U\+S\+L/\+G\+N\+U S\+U\+N/java-\/getopt\char`\"{}
