    <title>JavaDoc API Markup for vw4tools</title>

<para>Tools and utilities for VirtualWisdom4</para>

<para>At current, VW4Tools is a script or two, plus one big jar file. vw4tool.jar allows a user to import a text file in one of several formats and output an Entity import JSON for VirtualWisdom4.</para>

<para>VW4Tools is intentionally 100% opensource to both show the code a user may be running on a trusted server, and to emphasize that Support is also of the OpenSource variety (ie not by VI Support).</para>

<para>With the exception of samples/import01.json, all files and content are based on the same level of access to the product enjoyed by a customer. Implicitly, no private information is shared, all of this content (save the one file) is based on empirical discovery, and could change overnight. </para>
